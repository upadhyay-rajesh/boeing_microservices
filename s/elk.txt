What is ELK? Need for it?

The ELK Stack consists of three open-source products - Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana from Elastic.
Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that is based on the Lucene search engine.
Logstash is a log pipeline tool that accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and exports the data to various targets. It is a dynamic data collection pipeline with an extensible plugin ecosystem and strong Elasticsearch synergy
Kibana is a visualization UI layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.


how to implement

step 1 : download kibana,logstash and elastic from following link
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

unzip all

step 2 : 
start elastic as follow
elasticsearch.bat using the command prompt. Elasticsearch can then be accessed at localhost:9200

uncomment the following line in kibana.yml-
elasticsearch.host: "http://localhost:9200"

start kibana as follow
kibana.bat using the command prompt. 
run localhost:5601

create a file called logstash.conf and write the below content
input {
  file {
    type => "java"
    path => "C:/elk/spring-boot-elk.log"
    codec => multiline {
      pattern => "^%{YEAR}-%{MONTHNUM}-%{MONTHDAY} %{TIME}.*"
      negate => "true"
      what => "previous"
    }
  }
}
 
filter {
  #If log line contains tab character followed by 'at' then we will tag that entry as stacktrace
  if [message] =~ "\tat" {
    grok {
      match => ["message", "^(\tat)"]
      add_tag => ["stacktrace"]
    }
  }
 
}
 
output {
   
  stdout {
    codec => rubydebug
  }
 
  # Sending properly parsed log events to elasticsearch
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
  }
}

run logstash as follow
logstash -f logstash.conf


step 3 :

now go to your application and write the log as follow

private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(ELKController.class.getName());


@RequestMapping(value = "/elk")
	public String helloWorld() {
		String response = "i will come in log file check my location from properties file" + new Date();
		LOG.log(Level.INFO, response);

		return response;
	}

	@RequestMapping(value = "/exception")
	public String exception() {
		String response = "";
		try {
			throw new Exception("Exception has occured....");
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			LOG.error(e);

			StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
			PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sw);
			e.printStackTrace(pw);
			String stackTrace = sw.toString();
			LOG.error("Exception - " + stackTrace);
			response = stackTrace;
		}

		return response;
	}

step 4

go to application.properties file and write the following line

logging.file=C:/elk/spring-boot-elk.log
